The work presents a fundamental theory of artificial learning that aims to explain existing optimization algorithms used to train artificial intelligence models and to support the development of new ones. It is based on a thermodynamic framework, employing geometric and a Hamiltonian formalism to derive the evolution equations of learning. These equations provide a physical grounding for the learning process and show that it can be understood as a thermodynamic process in which models evolve according to the information they perceive.
